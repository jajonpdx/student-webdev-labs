## Reflection Document

### HTML

- I played the videos and worked ahead of them. For example, I typed out the table code with the video playing, and then used the video to check my work. I found that I had forgotten to add a thead tag for the header section. This was helpful, because, when I got to the body section, I already knew not to skip the tbody tag.
- I found the form exercise to be very helpful. The forms are fairly straightforward, but there are a lot of little details that are easy to get tripped up on, like making sure that the "for", "id", and "name" attributes for labels and input tags are coordinated correctly. It was helpful to have an example to work through to get it solidified in my head.
- Everything was explained very well.
- I felt like these exercises have thoroughly prepared me for the next steps in the web development learning plan.
