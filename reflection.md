## Reflection Document

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

### HTML

- I played the videos and worked ahead of them. For example, I typed out the table code with the video playing, and then used the video to check my work. I found that I had forgotten to add a thead tag for the header section. This was helpful, because, when I got to the body section, I already knew not to skip the tbody tag.
- I found the form exercise to be very helpful. The forms are fairly straightforward, but there are a lot of little details that are easy to get tripped up on, like making sure that the "for", "id", and "name" attributes for labels and input tags are coordinated correctly. It was helpful to have an example to work through to get it solidified in my head.
- Everything was explained very well.
- I felt like these exercises have thoroughly prepared me for the next steps in the web development learning plan.

### Accessibility

- I decided to stick with the same approach as last time, and I worked along with the video.
- The exercise, like with last week's, was very helpful. It is good to have a chance to put what we're learning in class to use in a guided manner. It is a good "training wheels" step toward doing it completely on our own. One thing that was helpful as a resource, in this case, was that the exercises playlist also contained recordings of the a11y lecture from a previous quarter. It was nice to have that available as a refresher.
- Again, the content was explained very clearly.
- I do not have any suggestions for improving coverage of the topic. I felt like it was conveyed well.
