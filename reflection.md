## Reflection Document

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

### HTML

- I played the videos and worked ahead of them. For example, I typed out the table code with the video playing, and then used the video to check my work. I found that I had forgotten to add a thead tag for the header section. This was helpful, because, when I got to the body section, I already knew not to skip the tbody tag.
- I found the form exercise to be very helpful. The forms are fairly straightforward, but there are a lot of little details that are easy to get tripped up on, like making sure that the "for", "id", and "name" attributes for labels and input tags are coordinated correctly. It was helpful to have an example to work through to get it solidified in my head.
- Everything was explained very well.
- I felt like these exercises have thoroughly prepared me for the next steps in the web development learning plan.

### Accessibility

- I decided to stick with the same approach as last time, and I worked along with the video.
- The exercise, like with last week's, was very helpful. It is good to have a chance to put what we're learning in class to use in a guided manner. It is a good "training wheels" step toward doing it completely on our own. One thing that was helpful as a resource, in this case, was that the exercises playlist also contained recordings of the a11y lecture from a previous quarter. It was nice to have that available as a refresher.
- Again, the content was explained very clearly.
- I do not have any suggestions for improving coverage of the topic. I felt like it was conveyed well.

### CSS

- I continued following along with the videos. They are very well organized and I find the directed learning approach to be very helpful for my learning style.
- The exercises were very helpful. The media queries was particularly helpful for me. Setting the page size breakpoints and figuring out where to add the various styles (like making sure to design for mobile first and then editing from there) was really helpful to see a walkthrough of.
- Everything was very clear.
- Nothing comes to mind for more exercises to add to these labs.

### Flexbox

- I very much appreciate having the videos to assist in the completion of these exercises. For this one, I did something similar to the earlier labs, where I played the video and then worked ahead of it, using the video to check my work. However, in this case, I was not being particularly successful in reproducing the screenshots, so I moved back to working along with the video.
- These exercises were great! I liked that they were designed to address all of the common values for the flex options (direction, wrap, justify, align, height/width).
- I have nothing to call out about needing to be explained better. I thought these were explaiend very clearly in the video.
- I don't have any suggestions for anything to add.
